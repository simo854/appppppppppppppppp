                        Set in an alternate America ruled by a totalitarian political party, the series follows several
                        seemingly unrelated characters living in a small city. As the clock winds down to the start of
                        the annual Purge - a 12-hour period when all crime, including murder, is legal - each character
                        is forced to reckon with their past as they discover how far they will go to survive the night.
                        The series explores themes of class, race, politics, and human nature through the lens of this
                        horrific annual tradition.

                        Sam Gardner is an 18-year-old on the autism spectrum who has decided he is ready for romance. In
                        order to start dating — and hopefully find love — Sam will need to be more independent, which
                        also sends his mother on her own life-changing path. She must learn to let go of her son so he
                        can grow up and live his own life. The series explores the triumphs and challenges that come

                    <h3>The Mick</h3>
                    <p style="display: none;">
                        An American television sitcom that follows Mackenzie "Mickey" Murphy, a hard-living,
                        foul-mouthed, cigarette-smoking woman from Rhode Island who moves to affluent Greenwich,
                        Connecticut to raise the spoiled kids of her wealthy sister, who has fled the country to avoid a
                        federal indictment. Mickey quickly learns what the rest of us already know - other people's
                        children are awful! Starring Kaitlin Olson in a powerhouse comedic performance, this
                        no-holds-barred single-camera comedy gives new meaning to the phrase "dysfunctional family."
                        Created by Dave and John Chernin and produced by 20th Century Fox Television, the series
                        explores themes of family, responsibility, and class differences through Mickey's hilarious and
                        often outrageous attempts at guardianship. Despite being completely out of her element in the
                        world of privilege and proper behavior, Mickey discovers that maybe a little responsibility
                        isn't the buzzkill she always thought it would be.

                        on September 4, 2018, on FX. Set in the same fictional universe as Sons of Anarchy, the series
                        is a spinoff that follows the Mayans Motorcycle Club, former rivals-turned-allies of the Sons.
                        The show takes place two-and-a-half years after the events of Sons of Anarchy in the fictional
                        California border town of Santo Padre. It focuses on the struggles of Ezekiel 'EZ' Reyes, a
                        gifted son of a proud Mexican family who is fresh out of prison and becomes a prospect in the
                        Mayans M.C. charter on the U.S.–Mexico border. EZ must carve out his new outlaw identity in a
                        town where he once was the golden boy with the American Dream in his grasp. The series explores
                        themes of family, loyalty, vengeance, and the Latino experience while examining the complex
                        relationships between the motorcycle club, drug cartels, and law enforcement. With its gritty
                        storytelling and authentic portrayal of Latino culture, Mayans M.C. stands as its own powerful
                        narrative while honoring the legacy of Sons of Anarchy.

                    <p style="display: none;">
                        Malcolm Bright is a gifted criminal psychologist whose father Martin Whitly is an infamous
                        serial killer known as "The Surgeon." After discovering his father's crimes as a child and
                        alerting police, Malcolm has spent years trying to distance himself from his dark family legacy.
                        Now working as a consultant for the NYPD, Malcolm uses his twisted genius and unique insight
                        into how killers think to help solve crimes and stop murderers. The series follows Malcolm as he
                        deals with his manipulative mother Jessica, his ambitious TV journalist sister Ainsley, and his
                        own psychological demons while being forced to confront his imprisoned father when copycat
                        killers emerge. Created by Chris Fedak and Sam Sklaver, the show explores themes of family
                        trauma, nature versus nurture, and the psychological impact of living with the legacy of a
                        serial killer parent.

                        undercover inside one of America's most dangerous motorcycle gangs. Based on Falco's memoir

                        outlaw bikers, where respect is earned through fear and violence. The show provides an

                        Burn Notice follows Michael Westen, a former spy who finds himself stranded in Miami after being
                        'burned' by his intelligence agency. With his assets frozen and his identity compromised,
                        Michael uses his unique skills to help people in desperate situations while trying to uncover
                        who burned him and why. Assisted by his ex-girlfriend Fiona Glenanne, an ex-IRA operative with a
                        love for explosives, and his friend Sam Axe, a former Navy SEAL turned beach bum, Michael takes
                        on various clients who need help when the law can't. The series combines procedural cases with
                        an overarching mythology about Michael's quest for answers, featuring clever spy tactics,
                        improvised gadgets, and Michael's signature voice-over narration explaining spy techniques and
                        tradecraft.

                        who becomes Pope Alexander VI through cunning political maneuvering and bribery, transforming
                        the papacy into a powerful political machine. Jeremy Irons delivers a commanding performance as

                        engage in plots involving murder, incest, betrayal, and corruption. Set against the backdrop of
                        Renaissance Italy's artistic and cultural flowering, the series depicts the stark contrast
                        between religious piety and moral decadence that defined this tumultuous period in history.

                    <h3>1923</h3>
                    <p style="display: none;">
                        1923 is a gripping Western drama series and prequel to Yellowstone, created by Taylor Sheridan,
                        that chronicles the Dutton family's struggles during one of the most challenging periods in
                        American history. Set in the titular year, the series follows Jacob Dutton and his wife Cara as
                        they fight to protect their family's Montana ranch during the era of Prohibition, the Great
                        Depression, and severe drought. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren lead the cast as the Dutton
                        patriarch and matriarch, navigating threats from cattle thieves, land developers, and the
                        changing economic landscape of the American West. The series also follows Spencer Dutton,
                        Jacob's nephew, as he works as a big game hunter in Africa while grappling with his traumatic
                        experiences from World War I. With its sweeping cinematography and complex storytelling, 1923
                        explores themes of family legacy, survival, and the cost of preserving a way of life in the face
                        of modernization and economic upheaval.

                    <h3>The Strain</h3>
                    <p style="display: none;">
                        The Strain is a dark horror series based on the novel trilogy by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck
                        Hogan that reimagines the vampire apocalypse as a viral outbreak threatening humanity's
                        survival. The series follows Dr. Ephraim Goodweather, head of the CDC's Canary Team, who
                        investigates a mysterious viral outbreak with hallmarks of an ancient strain of vampirism after
                        a Boeing 777 lands at JFK Airport with all but four passengers dead. As the contagion spreads
                        rapidly throughout New York City, transforming victims into grotesque creatures called
                        'strigoi,' Eph teams up with an elderly pawnbroker and Holocaust survivor named Abraham
                        Setrakian, who has been hunting these creatures for decades. The series combines body horror
                        with apocalyptic themes, exploring how society collapses when faced with an enemy that turns
                        loved ones into monsters. With its unique take on vampire mythology, practical effects, and
                        conspiracy elements involving ancient parasitic masters, The Strain delivers a visceral
                        examination of survival horror.

                        while navigating the treacherous political landscape of Renaissance Italy. After the mysterious

                        families, corrupt officials, and political conspiracies that threaten to destroy everything the
                        Medicis have built. The show explores how the Medici family became patrons of the arts,

                        from killing animals to murdering Alyssa quickly transforms into an unexpected road trip across
                        England. Based on Charles Forsman's graphic novel, the series explores themes of teenage

                        A gritty Amazon Prime police procedural starring Titus Welliver as Harry Bosch, a tenacious Los
                        Angeles Police Department homicide detective working in the Hollywood Division. Based on Michael
                        Connelly's bestselling novels, the series follows Bosch as he investigates complex murder cases
                        while navigating the dark side of the police department and pursuing justice at all costs. A

                        authentic backdrop of Los Angeles, the series explores themes of justice, redemption, and the
                        lengths one man will go to uncover the truth in a city where corruption runs deep.

                        A dark reimagining of mermaid mythology set in the coastal town of Bristol Cove, known for its
                        mermaid folklore. When a mysterious girl named Ryn arrives in town, marine biologist Ben Pownall
                        and his girlfriend Maddie Bishop discover she is actually a mermaid seeking her captured sister.
                        As more mermaids emerge from the depths, the town faces an ancient conflict between land and
                        sea. The series explores environmental themes, predator-prey relationships, and the darker side
                        of mermaid legends, portraying these sea creatures as fierce, intelligent hunters rather than
                        romantic fairy tale beings.

                    <p style="display: none;">
                        Set fifteen years after a worldwide blackout that permanently disabled all electric power,
                        Revolution follows Charlie Matheson as she searches for her kidnapped brother in a
                        post-apocalyptic world. When all electricity mysteriously stopped working, civilization
                        collapsed, governments fell, and militias rose to fill the power vacuum. Charlie's journey to
                        find her brother leads her to discover the truth behind the blackout and the existence of
                        devices that can restore power. As she navigates this dangerous new world filled with warlords
                        and militias, she uncovers a conspiracy involving her own family and the mysterious force that
                        caused the blackout.
